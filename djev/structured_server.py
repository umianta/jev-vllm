"""Structured decisions in front of a vLLM DiffusionGemma server.

POST /v1/systemone takes Jev's request body: {"model", "state", "questions"}.
"questions" maps an id to {"type", "instructions", "criteria"}, where "type"
is "noul", "choice", "score", "span" or "spans" and the criteria shape
follows the type:
  noul:   optional {"true": ..., "false": ...} descriptions
  choice: option name -> description or null
  score:  ordered list of levels
  span:   optional {"max_tokens": n}; the answer is a piece of the text
  spans:  optional {"max_tokens": n, "max_items": n}; every such piece
Answers take Jev's shapes, with this server's diagnostics alongside:
  noul:   {"noul": p}
  choice: {"choice", "probabilities", "confidence"}
  score:  {"score", "legend", "probabilities", "confidence"}
  span:   {"found", "text", "start", "end", "confidence", "coverage"}
  spans:  {"found", "items": [{"text", "start", "end", "confidence"}]}
A span is a substring of the state's text, by construction: the model fills
a pinned blank by copying, only the text's own token ids are read, and the
decode walks the text with those tokens. "start" and "end" are character
offsets into the state when it is a string, else into its "text" field.
The request body may also carry the schema keys "instructions", "samples",
"auto_max", "auto_threshold", "steps", "think", "ask", "chunk_rows",
"chunk_prompt" and "sequential" as extensions. Images go ahead of the
state, either as multipart/form-data with the JSON body in a part named
"request" and each image as a file part, or as an "images" array of data
URLs in the JSON body.

POST /v1/chat/completions makes the same decision from an OpenAI-shaped
call. The system message is the schema JSON below and the user message is
the state. The reply's `content` is the JSON answer set.

POST /v1/raw/chat/completions passes the body to vLLM's chat completions
unchanged, for plain generation through this port.

With API_KEY set in the environment, every POST needs "Authorization:
Bearer <key>". --tls-port adds an HTTPS listener with a self-signed
certificate kept in --cert-dir, for clients that need a secure origin.

Each answer is one distribution per question, from one denoise step over a
seeded canvas, averaged over a few noise draws. This server handles the
canvas, tokenizer, slot resolution, noise draws and averaging.

Schema (system message):
  {"questions": [
     {"id": "urgent", "type": "noul", "instructions": "..."},
     {"id": "bucket", "type": "choice", "instructions": "...",
      "options": [{"name": "billing", "description": "..."}, ...]},
     {"id": "tone", "type": "score", "instructions": "...",
      "levels": ["calm", "annoyed", "furious"]}],
   "instructions": "optional context",
   "samples": "auto" | N, "auto_threshold": 0.1, "auto_max": 4,
   "steps": 1, "think": 0}

A question may also declare:
  "depends_on": [ids]        answered after those, with their answers in
                             its prompt
  "ask_if": {id: [answers]}  asked only when that question's answer is
                             among them (a skipped answer is null)
  "alone": true              a read of its own
Questions run in stages by these dependencies. Each stage is one joint
read. Later stages continue the earlier answers, prefilled for a text
state and restated for an image.

Up to ten questions answer as "id: label" lines. Past that the id runs
straight into the label, space separated, one row fewer per question. The
server splits a schema whose answer template does not fit the canvas into
chunks that run together, each with its own question list. "chunk_rows"
sets the rows per chunk, "ask" picks a subset of question ids for one
read, "sequential": true runs the chunks in order with the earlier answers
prefilled, and "chunk_prompt": "shared" lists every question in each
chunk's prompt. "think": N lets the model write up to N tokens in its
thought channel, as an ordinary generation, and the read then runs with
that thought in its prompt. With images the model writes the thought with
the image in view and the server seeds it into the canvas ahead of the
answer, so the canvas bounds it. The noise draws of a decision share one
thought.

Serve the model with a canvas that holds the answer template, for example:
  vllm serve google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it \
      --diffusion-config '{"canvas_length": 64}' --max-logprobs 32 \
      --enable-prefix-caching
then run this in front of it:
  python structured_server.py --upstream http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
      --tokenizer google/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it --canvas 64 --port 8011

Two flags use engine features that are not in vLLM main yet, so both are off
by default. --constrained reads over the labels only (vllm-project/vllm#58216):
the same argmax for about a quarter less GPU time, with logprobs normalized
over the labels, so label mass is always 1. --engine-samples sends a fixed
sample count as one diffusion_samples request (vllm-project/vllm#58438)
instead of one request per draw.
